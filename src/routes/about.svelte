	This is a SvelteKit application styled with Tailwind CSS that uses the Pokemon API to build a
	Pokedex.

<p class="dark:text-white pb-5">
	Having finished a Svelte tutorial which covered Sapper, I began investigating projects, templates,
	setups, etc. and soon found out that SvelteKit had come into popularity as an official replacement
	for Sapper. Thus, I did this tutorial to familarize myself with SvelteKit.

<ul class="dark:text-white list-disc ml-5">
	<li>Light and dark mode toggling.</li>
