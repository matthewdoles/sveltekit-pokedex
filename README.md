# sveltekit-pokedex

### About

This is a SvelteKit application styled with Tailwind CSS that uses the Pokemon API to build a
Pokedex.

This application is the follow along code for James Q Quick's tutorial video [SvelteKit Crash Course - SSR, API Routes, Stores, Tailwind CSS, and More!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UU7MgYIbtAk&t=125s)

Having finished a Svelte tutorial which covered Sapper, I began investigating projects, templates, setups, etc. and soon found out that SvelteKit had come into popularity as an official replacement for Sapper. Thus, I did this tutorial to familarize myself with SvelteKit.
